# TALMA-on-ALPS

This repository contains the demo code for our research work:  
**"A Physiotherapy Video Matching Method Supporting Arbitrary Camera Placement via Angle-of-Limb-based Posture Structures."**  

TALMA-on-ALPS is a physiotherapy video matching system designed to **accurately align patient rehabilitation movements with mentor demonstrations**. By leveraging **Angle-of-Limb-based Posture Structures (ALPS)**, the method ensures robust **camera-independent** matching for **remote physiotherapy applications**.
